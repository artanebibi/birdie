## 3D Turn Based Battle System

Animation state's will be used for basic animation cycling, But for stuff like skill's. I thought about using the database approach! (This may not need to be enforced, But commenting on this can help me redact the: AnimationID, Meaning all animations will have to find their own name, And identifer in the animation state itself. [Could be easier])




These are using retargted animations, Just to show that they are possible with a 3d battle system like this.

## Similar Systems. 

The development of the battle system itself is being approached like the popular engine, RPG Maker!

With modular script's to allow inheritance to battler's and reused data/ai/functionality with all players in battle.

Though, With that being said! This project shouldn't be overcomplicated for a 2d implementation, It just won't be done by this same project, As the focus here has been commited to making a useable battle system for game's akin to Persona, Final Fantasy, And Pok√©mon.

## Project Description:
This battle system was gonna be used in my own projects, But as a collabrative effort, It will be open sourced, And maintained by the owner of this github repo. (The Game In Question Is Still In Development) [- Cute Fame 3D (Working Title)]
